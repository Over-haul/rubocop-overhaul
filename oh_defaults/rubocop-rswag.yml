# Why this file exist: Unfortunately, when "Exclude" is defined at department level, it's not merged with the ones
# defined at cop level, the department are overridden by them, as described here
# https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/issues/9983.
# Given the following config:
# RSpec:
#   Exclude:
#   - "spec/requests/**/*.rb"
#
# And:
# RSpec/LetSetup:
#   Exclude:
#     - "spec/api/controllers/create_spec.rb"
#
# The LetSetup exclusion will not be applied to /request/**/*.rb tests and RSpec/LetSetup offenses will be seen
# for requests tests. So, this file ignores all rspec offenses for all requests tests at cop level, because the
# exclude works well at this level.
